#Initially

I have been having issues with my GitHub set-up on my laptop, but I finally figured out what the issue was! (visible from my initial commits

#About

This website is covering Litecoin. My first cryptocurrency investment. Who founded, it and what cryptocurrencies are. This is related to my final year project (topic wise).

#Sections

I started splitting the information into 3 sections to hel display the information in a more concise manor.

I haven't started adding the css instead I am concentrating on the core layout in html first, to begin giving the website some structure. All information or text i use will be listed in a seperate references section in this readme doc.
