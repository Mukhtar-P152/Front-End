# Front-End

#Initially

I have been having issues with my GitHub set-up on my laptop, but I finally figured out what the issue was! (visible from my initial commits

This website is covering Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is an industry that is of interest to me for the past year. It is also related to my final year project.

#Sections

I started splitting the information into 3 sections to hel display the information in a more concise manor.

I haven't started adding the css instead I am concentrating on the core layout in html first, to begin giving the website some structure. All information or text i use will be listed in a seperate references section in this readme doc.

In the middle of me writing my css code, the Notepadd ++ applicaiton convieniently crashed on me but I overcame this hurdle!

When developing the layout of the website i used some inspiration from previous lab work.

I used the PARC design principle when developing the website. 

Used Proximity to group content with common styling.
Used Alignment to place items thoughtfully and create a layout
Used Repetition to repeat the design over different pages throughout
Used Contrast Simple colourway and themed and visually inviting

Accessibility of website design. 

Mobile first design.

#User Testing

I got my younger siblings who aren't as computer lterate to test and play around with the website in different responsive layouts. i then changed it accordingly. The navigation around the website. i forgot to include a home button for them to go back to the index page. I got this added because of user testing.
